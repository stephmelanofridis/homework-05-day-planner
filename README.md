# homework-05-day-planner

The homework for this week is as follows:

Create a day planner

-When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top
-When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours ( 9am - 5pm )
-When that day is viewed, it is color coded to indicate whether it is past, present or future
-When a timeblock is clicked, an event can be entered
-When the save button is clicked, the text for that event is saved to local storage
-When the page is refreshed, the saved event remains

I have been able to acheive the current date and time being displayed, and have used form input to fill in the time blocks. I have not been able to acheive the color coding for past, present and future, or been able to get Local Storage to work properly.

My knowledge of Javascript foundations are not strong enough to achieve what is being asked of this assignment, so I am focusing on studying hard on Javascript foundations and will revisit this when I have a better understanding!
