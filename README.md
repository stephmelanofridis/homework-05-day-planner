# Day Planner

An updated day planner that now complies with the homework requirements.

My day planner includes:

* Current date and time displayed at top of page
* Time blocks for standard business hours ( 9am - 5pm ), appended using jQuery
* Colour coded time blocks to indicate past, present and future
* Clickable field where a task can be entered by the user
* Save button to store what is entered to local storage
* When the page is refreshed, the saved task will remain

When I first attempted this homework I was able to acheive current time and date display at the top of page, and used Bootstrap to create the timeblocks. I was not able to achieve the colour coding for past, present and future and was not able to use local storage.

With some more time and research I have been able to revisit this homework and submit something better that complies with the requirements of the homework. I have updated my code and instead of using HTML and Bootstrap to create the form elements, I have instead used jQuery. I have used jQuery to create and append elements and also add classes to them that connect with the CSS style sheet provided. I have also updated my moment.js code so that it continuously updates which it did not do before.

# Technologies Used

In this project I have used starter code provided for the homework for HTML and CSS. I have then used jQuery, Bootstrap and moment.js to complete the tasks above.
